_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

- Rounding error from (stETH/wstETH) conversion
- Owner is TechOps multisig
- We did not add ERC20 Permits, we could add them later
- We assume the user will chose the correct external function based on their collateral type (ETH/WETH/stETH/wstETH)
- DEX is hardcoded and will either be 0x or 1Inch
- A user is expected to rationally chose between normal zap router and leverage zap router

### EIP compliance checklist
N/A



# Additional context

## Main invariants

- Position manager permit needs to be revoked after each operation
- ZapRouter contract should not hold any CDP positions
- ZapRouter contract should not have any tokens after each operation (aside from rounding)

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
- Fee should be assessed only when debt increases
- Owner cannot execute arbitrary calls


## All trusted roles in the protocol

| TechOps multisig                          | Can rescue tokens             |
