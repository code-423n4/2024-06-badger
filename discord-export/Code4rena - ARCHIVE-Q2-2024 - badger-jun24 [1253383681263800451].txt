hey! I dont understand why to openCDPWithEth() needs to do a flash loan? Why somebody wants to do that?


[06/27/2024 19:16] 0xsafuwei
The LeverageZapRouter is specifically designed to create leveraged CDP positions. In order to avoid looping manually, a flash loan is used for the collateral that will be paid back with the borrowed eBTC.


[06/27/2024 19:16] 0xsafuwei
normal unleveraged positions will not go through this router


[06/27/2024 19:18] ivanfitro
mmm...ok i see, but the flash loan needs to be paid in the same transaction, this is done first by the protocol and next the user when closes the CDP returns this eBTC to the protocol?


[06/27/2024 19:18] 0xsafuwei
yeah, the flash loan is paid back in the same transaction with the borrowed eBTC (converted to stETH with a swap)


[06/27/2024 19:20] ivanfitro
ok but if the eBTC that users borrows is converted to stETH to paid the flash loan, the user doesn't has this eBTC to do things no?


[06/27/2024 19:21] 0xsafuwei
yeah, the user does not receive any eBTC in this case, just a leveraged position


[06/27/2024 19:21] 0xsafuwei
normally, you would have to do that manually


[06/27/2024 19:22] ivanfitro

one more thing sorry, but is not better not using a flash loan, only swaps the eBTC minted to stETH and redeposit?


[06/27/2024 19:39] 0xsafuwei
then you'd need to keep looping right?


[06/27/2024 19:40] 0xsafuwei
a flash loan would get you to the end state in one go


[06/27/2024 19:41] 0xsafuwei
isn't that what everyone wants in defi? max leverage? 🙂

what is delta ?

```
event ZapOperationEthVariant(
        bytes32 indexed cdpId,
        EthVariantZapOperationType indexed operation,
        bool isCollateralIncrease,
        address indexed collateralToken,
       @> uint256 collateralTokenDelta,
        @>uint256 stEthDelta,
        address cdpOwner
    );
```


[06/27/2024 21:27] 0xsafuwei
basically the amount of collateral token / stETH transferred from the user


[06/27/2024 21:28] 0xsafuwei
stEthDelta is always stETH, collateralTokenDelta can be (eth/wstETH/weth etc.)

I do not see that user pay back to flash loaner, Or do I miss something ? thanks


[06/28/2024 00:19] 0xsafuwei
the flash lender will pull the funds back, for example https://github.com/ebtc-protocol/ebtc/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/ActivePool.sol#L311


[06/28/2024 00:19] 0xsafuwei
ebtc protocol itself is not in scope though


[06/28/2024 00:19] 0xsafuwei
so you can assume the flash lender is working correctly


[06/28/2024 00:20] lian0669
Got it, Thanks


[06/28/2024 11:51] mgnfy_view
If I get it correctly, user deposits some stETH margin, then flash loans some stETH, then using the margin stETH + the flash loan stETH mints debt eBTC, then swaps eBTC for stETH, then some of that stETH is used to pay back flash loan, and some stETH is returned


[06/28/2024 11:52] mgnfy_view
What exactly is the leveraged position here?


[06/28/2024 13:42] wanziskata
@jwei / @Alex The Entreprenerd I've opened a private thread, please check it out once possible. Thanks!


[06/28/2024 13:43] agadzhalov
I don't get where the profits for user and for the protocol come from. Also are there any fees involved?

In this scenario 
User has 10 stETH -> Flash Loans 90 stETH -> Provides 100 stETH in total as collateral -> Opens CDP position and mint eBTC -> Swaps eBTC for stETH -> Repays the flash loan with stETH

What happens then? How much the user has earned and how much the protocol has earned/collected in fees? Also is there anything that happens between opening CDP position and before swap of eBTC and stETH?


[06/28/2024 13:47] ivanfitro
I think you are right, you are leveraged because you has more collateral (10stETH and now 100stETH) this is why is leveraged, because you only can access to 10stETH, but using the FL you can increment your collaeral position


[06/28/2024 14:18] ivanfitro
Which protocol will be used for obtain the Flash Loan?


[06/28/2024 15:20] alextheentreprenerd
eBTC doesn't add a reentrant lock on FL, so you can FL it's own reserves to lever up:

eBTC AP:
https://github.com/ebtc-protocol/ebtc/blob/bfbe735865989df23d840e5df8c57cca88336a37/packages/contracts/contracts/ActivePool.sol#L289

eBTC BO:
https://github.com/ebtc-protocol/ebtc/blob/bfbe735865989df23d840e5df8c57cca88336a37/packages/contracts/contracts/BorrowerOperations.sol#L1091

{Reactions}
👍 

[06/28/2024 18:09] mgnfy_view
Yeah, so as I understand now, you can leverage the 100 stETH locked up as collateral in the contract but you don't have any eBTC because it's all used up in the swap to pay the flash loan. If the price of stETH increases, you can flash loan eBTC and pay your debt and get your stETH back.


[06/28/2024 18:10] mgnfy_view
However, if the price of stETH decreases then you are liquidatable?


[06/28/2024 18:11] mgnfy_view
How can you get back your collateral in this case?


[06/28/2024 18:29] alextheentreprenerd

Does protocol plan to use other erc20 tokens?


[06/28/2024 20:49] 0xsafuwei
not directly, no


[06/28/2024 20:50] 0xsafuwei
it's possible for the protocol to give eBtc minting auth to other contracts


[06/28/2024 20:50] 0xsafuwei
but it will be up to those contracts to deal with other erc20 tokens


[06/28/2024 20:50] 0xsafuwei
and auth is controlled by governance


[06/29/2024 03:05] weebad_
@jwei @Alex The Entreprenerd  
What's the purpose of the `willSweep`
internal immutable boolean state variable in the LeverageMacroBase contract?


[06/29/2024 03:12] 0xsafuwei
you can make the LeverageMacroBase contract sweep ebtc/stETH back to the sender automatically if you set `willSweep` to true


[06/29/2024 03:13] 0xsafuwei
`LeverageMacroBase` is meant to be a generic implementation for things that require flashLoan/leverage, not just for zaps, so it has some features that may or may not be used by the router


[06/29/2024 03:13] weebad_

[06/29/2024 07:19] mgnfy_view

all of the collateral different than stETH that is provided wstETH, ETH, WETH is then converted to stETH and deposited into Lido, is that correct? Do any of the contracts in scope lock any tokens?


[06/29/2024 12:11] mgnfy_view
Yes, all the margin balances are converted to stETH before moving forward. It is an invariant that the zap router should not hold/lock any tokens. Both residue eBTC and stETH are sweeped to the caller in each transaction

[06/29/2024 17:12] 0xsafuwei
there is no validation for the exchange payload itself, but we do have post swap checks (minExpected) as well as post operation checks (verify debt + collateral numbers)


[06/29/2024 17:33] 0xsafuwei
yeah, it's only charged when debt increases (open, adjust lever up). It's just a fee for using the router.

Guys as a security researcher we expect proper documentation from the team in order to understand it first . There is nothing much in readme .

thanks


[06/30/2024 13:44] _rickk137
but im not sure that works like slippage , I need a clear definition


[06/30/2024 17:17] 0xsafuwei
we do post operation checks to make sure the debt and collateral are the same as what we are expecting. `collValidationBuffer` allows the frontend (user) to relax that comparison. Setting it to 0 makes it very strict and adjusting it up and down gives you some room depending on what you think the slippage will be.

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[06/30/2024 17:47] saediek
You said setting it to zero would result in a strict slippage ??


[06/30/2024 17:47] 0xsafuwei
setting it to 0 will make  the post operation validation strict


[06/30/2024 17:48] 0xsafuwei
say you expect after openCdp, the collateral will be 5 stETH


[06/30/2024 17:48] 0xsafuwei
setting it to 0 will ensure that the collateral is at least 5 stETH


[06/30/2024 17:48] 0xsafuwei
adjusting the parameter will allow say 4.9999 stETH


[06/30/2024 17:48] 0xsafuwei

@jwei I believe it's imperative users put up a margin collateral when opening a cdp, right?  Is there some kind of invariant that must hold with respect to the expected Debt  for the cdp and this margin collateral?

yeah, it's generated by the frontend


[07/01/2024 05:46] mgnfy_view
Yes, some amount of margin collateral must be supplied. Otherwise the eBTC debt obtained would not be enough to repay the flash loan (110% over-collateralisation)


[07/01/2024 06:03] robert00_56
Hi, when margin == 0, what happened? nothing? Then what is mean "Higher margin should give you higher CR"? I do not understand this well


[07/01/2024 07:48] mgnfy_view
I think lower margin will risk you to be liquidated

@jwei @mgnfy_view @Alex The Entreprenerd In adjusting a cdp, the code comments reads that, users can make changes to their debt, and even top up their collateral. My question pertains to the Debt Changes. How much Debt Changes can a user make? I believe how much or less of a debt change is dependent on a user's collateral increment changes, right?


[07/01/2024 23:51] weebad_
The adjustment could be a debt repayment, right?


[07/01/2024 23:53] 0xsafuwei
the user can either lever up, borrow more up to max leverage (min CR) or unwind (reduce leverage)

[07/02/2024 10:38] daniel526
@jwei check private thread kindly


[07/02/2024 10:49] mgnfy_view
@Alex The Entreprenerd In `EbtcLeverageZapRouter::_adjustCdp()` the stETHBalanceChange for the operation is equal to the sum of flash loan amount and stETH margin balance?


[07/02/2024 15:04] 0xsafuwei
for lever up, stETHBalanceChange = flashLoanAmount + marginBalance - fees, for delever, stETHBalanceChange = flashLoanAmount (converted from eBtc) + fees


[07/02/2024 16:20] mgnfy_view
But if that's so, then why is the margin balance added again to the stETH balance change?


[07/02/2024 16:21] mgnfy_view
```javascript
uint256 marginDecrease = _params.isStEthBalanceIncrease ? 0 : _params.stEthBalanceChange;
        if (!_params.isStEthMarginIncrease && _params.stEthMarginBalance > 0) {
            marginDecrease += _params.stEthMarginBalance;
        }

        uint256 marginIncrease = _params.isStEthBalanceIncrease ? _params.stEthBalanceChange : 0;
        if (_params.isStEthMarginIncrease && _params.stEthMarginBalance > 0) {
            marginIncrease += _params.stEthMarginBalance;
        }
```


[07/02/2024 16:22] 0xsafuwei
yeah, it's added automatically, the UI only needs to provide flashLoan amount and marginBalance


[07/02/2024 16:22] mgnfy_view
Also, you need to supply margin for delever?


[07/02/2024 16:22] 0xsafuwei
for delever, it can be set to 0


[07/02/2024 16:23] mgnfy_view
Alright!

[07/03/2024 10:10] vizay315
can anyone tell us high level overview of this protocol.


[07/03/2024 11:53] jes16jupyter
Hi @jwei If `stETHBalanceChange = flashLoanAmount + marginBalance - fees` , how will the flashloan be repaid. I guess it's `ebtc minted(swapped to stETH) + part of marginBalance`?


[07/03/2024 12:01] mgnfy_view
I think margin balance + flashloan stETH goes into the protocol to mint eBTC, then the eBTC is swapped for stETH and flashloan is paid back


[07/03/2024 12:03] jes16jupyter
Got it. That makes sense!


[07/03/2024 12:04] jes16jupyter
Thanks


[07/03/2024 12:04] jes16jupyter
So it seems the leverage won't be that high. like 10X or 100X as we see in CEX


[07/03/2024 12:06] jes16jupyter
But for delever, when we have a flashloan of `ebtc` to reduce the debt, how could we repay it? This still a bit confused to me. Seems like when we repay some `ebtc` debt, some `stETH` could be withdrawn, and we swap that to pay back


[07/03/2024 12:12] demorextess
let say CR 120%, if you reduce your debt like 100$ eBTC with 100% flash loan , you will get 120$ as stETH from CDP. You should set trade data correctly, it's used for swapping this stETH to eBTC. In this scenario you should set swap amount to 100$ minimum in order to repay 100$ eBTC flash loan. And the remainning 20$ is yours, it can be eBTC or stETH based on your tradedata

[07/03/2024 12:14] demorextess
Btw also there are some fees those are not exact amounts, just simulation


[07/03/2024 12:17] jes16jupyter
Thanks, so it seems that by reducing some debts, some assets are free to use. You could get 120$ or 110$ or kind of less in `stETH` (but should cover flashloan and fees). In this case, the `CR` could go higher if you withdraw less.


[07/03/2024 12:17] jes16jupyter
The whole system looks like a leverage of STETH/EBTC (only for Long) through the use of Lending/Flashloan to me.


[07/03/2024 12:23] demorextess
Your welcome, In my example CR is not changed, because still my remainning eBTC debt backed by same proportion of stETH. But of course you can increase this CR by paying your eBTC debt without claimming the stETH


[07/03/2024 12:23] demorextess
Yeah similar

Hello, I've read the whole channel but still can't get it clear.
When opening a leverage CDP, at the end of the transaction, does the user hold any token? I assume he should hold some eBTC which he could use right away to repay his debt and withdraw his collateral (assuming no price fluctuation happened), am I correct?


[07/03/2024 22:32] 0xsafuwei
no ebtc, at the end of the transaction, the user has a leveraged cdp position and maybe some stETH dust that gets swept back

{Reactions}
👍 

[07/03/2024 22:34] rahiti
And he is able to close it right away? Without repaying anything?


[07/03/2024 22:34] 0xsafuwei
yeah, closing a leveraged position will get your initial margin back - fees and slippage


[07/03/2024 22:35] 0xsafuwei
it's like buying a house, you put a certain amount of money down and end up with a house. If you sell the house right away, you get your initial down payment back - closing costs

what is the difference between `eBTCZap` and `eBTCLeverageZap` ?


[07/05/2024 12:55] mgnfy_view
The normal zap router doesn't use flash loan to open a leveraged position.


[07/05/2024 12:55] mgnfy_view
It can open normal cdp positions only


[07/05/2024 12:56] mgnfy_view
With leverage zap router you can lever up


[07/05/2024 13:01] stacey_59672
Is there any ratio that can be calculated by the formula between flashLoan and margin? For example for X margin we can take Ymax flashloan


[07/05/2024 13:18] lian0669
In doc: 
Redemptions are the protocol's mechanism for exchanging eBTC for stETH at face value, based on the spot BTC/stETH Oracle price. This means that redemptions allow for swapping at price parity, irrespective of the market price of eBTC.

To initiate a redemption, a user must transfer the desired amount of eBTC into the system. The system then calculates the equivalent amount of stETH based on the latest price returned by the Oracle.
That means  Redemptions like selling  exact amount  eBTC for stETH at the spot BTC/stETH Oracle price ？？


[07/05/2024 14:48] alextheentreprenerd

At any point in time, does the EbtcLeverageZapRouter  contract has some eBTC tokens?

I think not, since it's a Router. It tries to sweep any token left at the end of the operations.
